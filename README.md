# Modeling-of-90nm-NMOS-and-PMOS-FETs
Analytical model is developed using Matlab describing the transistor operation for both an N- and P-type MOSFETs.  
The model includes:  
    a. Ids-Vds, Ids-Vgs, for source & drain junctions characteristics  
    b. Gm, gd dependence on Vgs for Vds = 0.1V and Vds = Vdd.  
    c. Subthreshold, linear and saturation regimes  
    d. CLM, velocity saturation, mobility dependence on Vds and Vgs, Vth dependence on Vds and Lgate
